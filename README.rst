*Warning:* Synpipe is deprecated; it will be removed from the Rubin Observatory Science Pipelines distribution after release 21.0.0.
Tasks for inserting simulated sources are now provided by `pipe_tasks`_; see `community.lsst.org`_ for details.

Synpipe provides tasks which make use of the LSST fake object pipeline
to insert realistic galaxies and stars. It also includes scripts to
analyze the results of data which has been processed with fake objects
inserted.
